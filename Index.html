                <p>Welcome to WeChat!</p>

                <p>Your use of WeChat is subject to these Terms of Service (these <strong>"Terms"</strong>). Thank you
                    for
                    reviewing these
                    Terms – we hope you enjoy using WeChat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you have any questions about, or if you wish to send us any notices in relation to, these Terms,
                    please contact us by going to “Me” -> “Settings” -> “Help & Feedback” from within WeChat or by

                    <a href="#">help.wechat.com.</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>These Terms apply to you if you are a user of WeChat anywhere in the world, except if you
                        belong
                        in any of
                        the following categories: (a) a user of Weixin or WeChat in the People’s Republic of China; (b)
                        a
                        citizen of
                        the People’s Republic of China using Weixin or WeChat anywhere in the world; or (c) a
                        Chinese-incorporated
                        company using Weixin or WeChat anywhere in the world. If you belong to any of these categories,
                        please refer
                        to the</strong><a href="#">Terms of Service (PRC Users)</a> for the terms that apply to you.**
                    For
                    the purposes of these Terms, a
                    reference to “People’s Republic of China” does not include a reference to Taiwan, Hong Kong or
                    Macau. If
                    you
                    are a user of Weixin or WeChat and are located in Taiwan, Hong Kong or Macau, and are not in
                    categories
                    (b)
                    or (c) above, these Terms apply to you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please review these Terms and our policies and instructions to understand how you can and cannot use
                    WeChat. You must comply with these Terms in your use of WeChat and only use WeChat as permitted by
                    applicable laws and regulations, wherever you may be when you use them. In some countries, there are
                    restrictions on your use of WeChat – it is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally
                    allowed to use WeChat where you are located, and certain WeChat functionalities may not be available
                    in some countries.
                </p>

                <p><strong>By using WeChat, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not
                        use WeChat.</strong></p>

                <p><i>Other general terms in relation to these Terms</i></p>

                <p>
                    If you are under the age of 13, you must not use WeChat. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18
                    (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction where you are considered a minor), your parent or guardian
                    must agree to these Terms (both for themselves and on your behalf) before you can use WeChat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you are using WeChat on behalf of a company, partnership, association, government or other
                    organisation (your “Organisation”), you warrant that you are authorised to do so and that you are
                    authorised to bind your Organisation to these Terms. In such circumstances, “you” will include your
                    Organisation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We may translate these Terms into multiple languages. If there is any difference between the English
                    version and any other language version of these Terms, the English version will apply (to the extent
                    permitted by applicable laws and regulations).
